# Agent Console API

The console API is the portable contract between the workspace UI and an agent
runtime.

Two implementations should satisfy this contract:

- Crawdad CF: hosted agents, Supabase auth, Cloudflare Containers, R2/DO state.
- Troublemaker standalone: one agent on a VPS, local auth/reverse proxy, local files.

The UI should not call container-private routes directly. Container routes such
as `/awareness/stream`, `/api/files`, `/api/file`, `/api/upload`, and
`/web/chat` are implementation details behind this contract.

## Routes

All routes are same-origin from the console UI.

```text
GET  /api/v2/session
GET  /api/v2/agents
GET  /api/v2/agents/:id/status
GET  /api/v2/agents/:id/events?limit=50&before=:offset
GET  /api/v2/agents/:id/events/stream
POST /api/v2/agents/:id/messages
POST /api/v2/agents/:id/messages/stop
GET  /api/v2/agents/:id/files?path=:path
GET  /api/v2/agents/:id/file?path=:path
PUT  /api/v2/agents/:id/file
POST /api/v2/agents/:id/upload
```

For Troublemaker standalone, `:id` may be `current`. Hosted Crawdad uses the
real agent UUID or name.

Hosted Crawdad also exposes control routes on the same `/api/v2` boundary:
`POST /api/v2/list`, `POST /api/v2/agents/:id/message`,
`POST /api/v2/agents/:id/configure`, `POST /api/v2/agents/:id/assign`,
`POST /api/v2/agents/:id/stop`, and `POST /api/v2/agents/:id/restart`.
Secret writes go through `configure` with either `target: "secrets.<key>"` or
`target: "secrets"` plus an object value. Crawdad stores those values in
`encrypted_secrets_v2`; responses return secret names only.

## Auth

Crawdad CF accepts:

- Supabase browser session cookies for the hosted web console.
- `tfat_oauth_*` Bearer tokens for OAuth/MCP/mobile clients.
- `tfat_live_*` Bearer tokens for API clients.

Troublemaker standalone currently assumes same-origin access and should be run
behind a local tunnel, reverse proxy auth, or a future standalone console token.

## Current State

The v2 console API is the product boundary for hosted web, standalone web, and
future mobile clients. Crawdad CF can satisfy cheap reads and status from the
Worker/R2 side when that is practical, but agent turns are container-backed:
`POST /messages` streams from Troublemaker's `/web/chat` gateway. The Worker is
not an agent runtime.

Fat Platform `/api/v1` is retired. New product integrations should use Crawdad
`/api/v2` with `tfat_live_*` API keys.

## Chat And Event Semantics

`POST /api/v2/agents/:id/messages` returns an SSE stream for the active turn.
Clients should treat that stream as the low-latency rendering path for the
message they just sent, then dedupe against durable awareness entries when the
same turn appears in `/events` or `/events/stream`.

`GET /api/v2/agents/:id/events/stream` emits only new durable awareness lines.
Each SSE message should include an `id` when the backing awareness line has an
`id` or timestamp, allowing browsers to provide `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect.
Clients still need duplicate filtering by parsed awareness entry id.

The durable event stream remains the source of truth. Optimistic chat entries
are UI affordances, not persistent state.
